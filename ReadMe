Supplemental Data for Immunohistochemical and ultrastructural characterization of the inner ear epithelial cells of splitnose rockfish (Sebastes diploproa) 
Shortname: RockfishInnerEarCharacterization

Supplemental Figure 1: Western blot analysis of splitnose rockfish inner ear homogenates. Antibodies against Na+/K+-ATPase (mNKA), 
V-type H+ ATPase (VHA), carbonic anhydrase (CA), Na+-K+-Clâˆ’-co-transporter (NKCC), otolith matrix protein 1 (OMP-1), 
and otolin-1 reveal bands matching the predicted size of respective proteins. Molecular marker is shown on the left of each respective blot.

Supplemental Figure 2: Immunolocalization of NKA, CA, VHA, Tubulin, and NKCC in hair cell (HC) and supporting cell (SC). 
The NKA-rich HC expresses both A) CA and B) VHA in its hair bundles (HB). The nuclei of the HC and SC forms two different parallel lines. 
C) When viewed laterally, the two rows of nuclei can be used to distinguish between HC and SC. 

Supplemental Figure 3: Scanning electron micrograph and immunolocalization of NKA and VHA of Type-I (T1-I) and T2-I Ionocytes (T2-I) 
at the intermediate area. A) T1-I near the intermediate area is much sparser relative to those near the macula. B) Similarly, 
the apical surface and microvilli of T2-I in the intermediate area are relatively barren and receded, respectively.
